#### ATX headings

https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#atx-heading

> An ATX heading consists of a string of characters, parsed as inline content,\
between an opening sequence of 1â€“6 unescaped # characters and an optional closing sequence of any number of unescaped # characters.

=> 1-6 `#` characters.

> The opening sequence of # characters must be followed by spaces or tabs, or by the end of line.

=> space/tab after the `#`s (end of line is probably for empty headings)
