#### sort by line number

When scanning the file the headings slice is automatically sorted by line number.

This is desired behavior to display out of tree headers at the actual position \
when printing the headings tree.

=> additional features like printing sections under a header will have to loop \
through the entire slice from start to end to also print duplicates
