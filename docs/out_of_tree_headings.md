#### how to deal with out of tree headings?

When printing the TOC.

It would be nice to see out of tree headers anyway because:\
1. then the user can easily see how to fix the structure
2. if they don't show up the user thinks those headings don't exist
3. according to commonmark any sequence of bytes is valid markdown

Maybe add a linter stage before printing the tree?
